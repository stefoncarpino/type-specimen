  <h1 id="about-the-typeface">About the Typeface</h1>
  <p> Courier is a monospaced slab serif typeface designed to resemble the output from a strike-on typewriter. The typeface was designed by Howard "Bud" Kettler in 1955, and it was later redrawn by Adrian Frutiger for the IBM Selectric Composer series of electric typewriters.</p>

<p>Although the design of the original Courier typeface was commissioned by IBM, the company deliberately chose not to secure legal exclusivity to the typeface and it soon became a standard font used throughout the typewriter industry. Because IBM deliberately chose not to seek any copyright, trademark, or design patent protection, the Courier typeface cannot be trademarked or copyrighted and is completely royalty free.</p>

<p>As a monospaced font, in the 1990s, it found renewed use in the electronic world in situations where columns of characters must be consistently aligned. It has also become an industry standard for all screenplays to be written in 12-point Courier or a close variant. 12-point Courier New was also the U.S. State Department's standard typeface until January 2004, when it was replaced with 14-point Times New Roman. Reasons for the change included the desire for a more "modern" and "legible" font.</p>

<p>Kettler was once quoted about how the name was chosen. The font was nearly released with the name "Messenger." After giving it some thought, Kettler said, "A letter can be just an ordinary messenger, or it can be the courier, which radiates dignity, prestige, and stability."</p>

<h1 id="designer">About the Designer</h1>
<p>Howard Kettler (born 1919, died 1999) designed Courier in 1955 for IBM.
Everyone recognizes it as the face originally designed for use on typewriters. A typical characteristic of older typewriters is that all characters are given the same amount of space regardless of their width. Hence, an i receives just as much room as an m, even though it is much thinner. This principle defined the look of Courier font. A line in this typeface has “holes” in what would otherwise be a homogenous look. Due to its origins, Courier is often associated with office and telegram-like text, as well as “top secret” or government-classified documents!</p>

<p>Typewriters have all but disappeared from the office and the practical need for such a typeface with them. Nevertheless, the attractive imperfections of Courier have long been appreciated for their usefulness in design applications. It is therefore often seen in advertisements, especially when the subject deals with messages, telegrams, etc.</p>

<p>Linotype offers Courier font in two different versions. First is Courier by Linotype, which is available in Regular and Bold weights, each with obliques. Courier by Linotype’s terminals are rounded. The second version, called simply Courier comes in the following weights: Regular, Medium, and Bold, with optional oblique, Central European, and Cyrillic companions. Courier’s terminals are flat.</p>

<h1 id="usage">Usage of the Typeface</h1>
<p>Courier isn’t a particularly legible typeface, nor does it look modern or elegant. Obviously it is well suited for documents that need to look as if they were created using a typewriter. It is also a good choice if you need an old-style government or bureaucratic look.</p>

<p>Since Courier is a monospaced font, which means that all characters have the same width, it can be practical in documents which contain aligned columns of text. There are better monospaced fonts around though, such as special versions of Helvetica and Lucida. If you only need to line up numbers, then there are also OpenType fonts that include both regular numerals and monospaced ones.</p>

<p>Most Hollywood screenplays are often written in 12 point Courier.
